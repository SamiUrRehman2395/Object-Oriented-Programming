/*
The hash function is a key-value mapping function.
When two or more keys are mapped to the same value using these hashing methods,
there exists duplicate values. The use of chain hashing prevents collisions.
Each hash table cell should lead to a linked list of entries that have the same
hash function value.

Hash Collision can be solved by
1. Open Addressing
2. Chaining
