Collections Framework :-
A collection represents group of objects java collections provides classes and interfaces
for us to be able to write the code quickly and efficiently

Why do we need collection?
We need collection for efficient storage and better manipulation of data in java
For Example,
We use arrays to store integers but what if we want to
1. Resize the array
2. Insert an element in between
3. Delete an element in between
4. Apply certain conditions to change the array

How are collections available?
Collections in java are available as classes and interfaces
Following are the commonly used collections in java

2. Set -->  for distinct collection

4. Hashmap --> for sharing key value pairs

Collection class is available in java.util package.
